# RotfData
Quick and scuffed gui to see server-wide death/loot stats as well as player name chosen death/loot stats

  The source is here on github along with 2 folders that were updated on 7/11/2019 at 4pm EST, and an executable version if you are unable to run or don't know how to run py files. Simply Click on the squid icon and itll open up the program in a couple seconds.

  Keep the Text documents in the same directory(folder) as the program, I did not setup search directory stuff so it will work with the files if they are in the right spot. don't rename the files either, simply click the application or run the python file.
  
  Fame gain is estimated with approximations since we are only given the base fame of a players death. Everything else is absolute, the program now runs significantly faster since Data cleaning is done outside of the program instead of on every boot.
