# RotfData
Quick and scuffed gui to see server-wide death/loot stats as well as player name chosen death/loot stats

  The source is here on github along with 2 folders that were updated on 7/11/2019 at 4pm EST, and an executable version if you are unable to run or don't know how to run py files. Simply Click on the squid icon and itll open up the program in a couple seconds.

  Keep the Text documents in the same directory(folder) as the program, I did not setup search directory stuff so it will work with the files if they are in the right spot. don't rename the files either, simply click the application or run the python file.
  
  If you wish to update the files you can use the update button in the program it does require a discord token which can be found by doing "ctrl+shift+i" in discord, scrolling down to the bottom of applications, hitting f5 to refresh it and copying the "token" that pops up(it's long and ugly looks like a mess, but it's a powerful mess, Do not share this token with anyone it grants access to your account.) 
We use this token to gather all of the information on Deaths/Legendary/Primal from the RotfDiscordNotifier bot. The text files get very big and the program will almost certainly enter "not responding" state that is fine, just go play games or do whatever when it is done it will make a neat windows pinging sound once. The 2 text files it gathers will automatically replace the older versions.



This was made very quickly yesterday and today, but it will get the job done for now. I will likely update it with quite a bit more involving the dates and times of each event for specified players. I belive it would be pretty neat to see a heatmap of primal drops across the notification bot's existence. 

Fame Gain is estimate using bracketed fame bonus estimations, read the python file to understand that better.

Enjoy ,if there are problems with Gui, tell me I guess(?), but chances are it's scuffed I don't do much with GUI
